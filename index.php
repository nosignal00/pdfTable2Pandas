<p>
You may have read about Bitcoin or heard about it at a ‘FinTech’ 
conference. You may have used Bitcoins to purchase pizza, coffee or 
even a spaceflight. Wherever the word has cropped up, fierce debates 
have often followed. Early adopters passionately claim that Bitcoin will 
remove dependencies on banks and governments. Hardened business 
tycoons advise that Bitcoin is just a ‘flash in the pan’.
<p>
While the debate about Bitcoin rages on, researchers have been quietly examining the technology that underpins this and 
other digital currencies. This is the realm of the blockchain – a protocol for exchanging value over the internet without 
an intermediary – and there is a growing buzz about how it might transform not just banking but many other industry 
sectors, too. 
<p>
In a recent survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF), a majority of experts and executives in the information and 
communications technology sector expected at least ten per cent of global GDP to be stored on blockchain platforms by 
2025. And while the WEF doesn’t expect the tipping point for the technology to occur until around 2027, we anticipate 
that adoption will occur much faster as a multitude of applications emerge in different sectors. 
<p>
But who can benefit from this technology? What are the key blockchain applications and how will they work? How do 
organisations create value from them? And what are the technical, cultural and commercial challenges they will face? This 
paper is part of a series of reports under the title of “Disrupt: Deliver” – Deloitte’s approach to developing understanding 
of and new points of view on disruptive technologies. And, in the following pages, we take a close look at the blockchain 
and tackle these questions.

In our view, there are new and emerging opportunities for organisations in all sectors to create and deliver compelling 
services for their customers using the power of disruptive innovation. As they formulate their plans for the coming 
months, we also hope that this paper helps business and public sector leaders understand the cultural and organisational 
challenges that are inevitably brought by the use of blockchain technologies, and provides them with the insights they 
need to overcome them. 
<p>
We hope that you find this paper useful and we look forward to your feedback.

<p>
“ Obviously a closed platform is a serious brake 
on innovation.”
<p>
Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web
<p>
Throughout history, many items have been used as 
a store of value, from cowrie shells and clay tablets 
to coins and today’s ubiquitous paper money. Even 
distributed payment networks have existed for 
millennia: thousands of years before the advent of 
Bitcoin, the people of South Asia, Africa and the 
Persian Gulf were using hawala for peer-to-peer money 
transfer.1 
<p>
As our understanding of money has matured, so 
have the methods and modes for exchanging it. The 
Bitcoin ‘experiment’, which was started by Satoshi 
Nakamoto (presumed to be a pseudonym) in 2008, 
has demonstrated that there can be a viable digital 
alternative to cash and other mediums of exchange 
in modern society.2 And although Bitcoin has had a 
chequered history, with its association with the dark 
net and websites like Silk Road, it has also triggered 
debates about the opportunities that come from the 
blockchain – the technology ‘backbone’ and protocols 
that Bitcoin and other digital currencies use.3 
<p>
According to the Bank of England, a blockchain is  
“a technology that allows people who don’t know  
each other to trust a shared record of events”.4  
This shared record, or ledger, is distributed to all 
participants in a network who use their computers to 
validate transactions and thus remove the need for a 
third party to intermediate.
<p>
The concept is approaching a tipping point in its 
adoption, according to the World Economic Forum.5 
VentureScanner.com estimates that there are 
now over 800 new ventures in the global Bitcoin 
‘ecosystem’, which have collectively raised over $1 
billion in funding.6 These companies include specialist 
Bitcoin exchanges, such as Coinbase and Itbit; Bitcoin 
‘miners’, such as Petamine and 21e6, which provide 
specialist computer hardware for validating Bitcoin 
transactions; Bitcoin wallet and payments companies, 
such as EasyWallet.org and CryptoPay; and many other 
infrastructure, news and related services companies.7 
<p>
In the FinTech space, the New York-based financial 
innovation start-up R3CEV has announced that it is 
working with over 40 banks to conduct research  
and experiments with the aim of creating a new  
industry-wide blockchain.8 Separately, Visa Europe, 
Westpac, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, 
RBS and many of the UK’s high street banks have all 
announced that they are working on their own  
proof-of-concepts using blockchain.9,10,11,12 Citi 
claims to have built three blockchains and its own 
cryptocurrency, ‘Citicoin’, to test them.13 And the 
first patent for a securities settlement system using 
cryptocurrencies has been filed by an investment 
bank.14

of events”.4 This shared record, 
or ledger, is distributed to all 
participants in a network who 
use their computers to validate 
transactions and thus remove 
the need for a third party to

<p>
For consumers, a growing number of mainstream 
merchants accept Bitcoin as payment for their goods or 
services. Overstock.com, one of the first major online 
retailers to accept Bitcoins, made more than $124,000 in 
Bitcoin sales on January 10, 2014, its first day of accepting 
the currency.15 Recently, Overstock.com became the first 
company to receive approval from the US Securities and 
Exchange Commission to issue shares using the Bitcoin 
blockchain.16
<p>
Understandably, the focus on digital currencies like Bitcoin 
has created a common misconception that blockchains 
are relevant only to the banking sector. “There has long 
been significant interest in the many different uses 
for blockchain technology,” says one commentator, 
“However, the ‘non-currency’ use-cases … have until 
recently, generally commanded less total mindshare than 
‘currency’ use-cases.”17 
<p>
So who else can benefit from a blockchain? How does it 
generate value? And, perhaps more importantly, how can 
the technology be applied to existing organisations and 
their current business models? 
<p>
This paper aims to address these questions and help 
leaders in different sectors navigate the emerging 
opportunities offered by blockchain technology. 
Blockchain’s impact is illustrated in four domains: banking, 
insurance, the public sector and the media industry. We 
also discuss some of the challenges as organisations start 
planning to adopt this technology.

<p>
“ The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. 
Nodes work all at once with little coordination.”18
<p>
Satoshi Nakamoto
<p>
How does a blockchain work?
In his original Bitcoin white paper, Satoshi Nakamoto 
defined an electronic coin – the Bitcoin – as “a chain 
of digital signatures” known as the ‘blockchain’.19 The 
blockchain enables each coin owner to transfer an amount 
of currency directly to any other party connected to the 
same network without the need for a financial institution 
to mediate the exchange. 
<p>
We can illustrate how a blockchain works by using Bitcoin 
as an example, as shown in Figure 1. Bitcoin, like other 
blockchains, uses cryptography to validate transactions, 
which is why digital currencies are often referred to 
as ‘cryptocurrencies’. Bitcoin users gain access to their 
balance through a password known as a private key. 
Transactions are validated by a network of users called 
‘miners’, who donate their computer power in exchange 
for the chance to gain additional bitcoins using a shared 
database and distributed processing.
<p>

To pay her, he 
needs two pieces
of information: 
his private key and 
her public key.
<p>
Bob owes Alice 
money for lunch.
He installs an app
on his smartphone 
to create a new 
Bitcoin wallet.
A wallet app is like a 
mobile banking app 
and a wallet is like a 
bank account.
<p>
Bob gets Alice’s 
public key by 
scanning a QR code 
from her phone, or 
by having her email 
him the payment 
address, a string of 
seemingly random 
numbers and 
letters.*
<p>
The miners verify 
that Bob has 
enough bitcoins to 
make the payment.
<p>
The app alerts 
Bitcoin ‘miners’ 
around the world of 
the impending 
transaction. ‘Miners’ 
provide transaction 
veriﬁcation services.
<p>
Many transactions 
occur in the network 
at any time. All the 
pending transactions 
in a given timeframe 
are grouped (in
a block) for 
veriﬁcation. Each 
block has a unique 
identifying number, 
creation time and 
reference to the 
previous block.
<p>

Despite its apparent complexity, a blockchain is just 
another type of database for recording transactions – 
one that is copied to all of the computers in a participating 
network.21 A blockchain is thus sometimes referred to as 
a ‘distributed ledger’. Data in a blockchain is stored in 
fixed structures called ‘blocks’. The important parts of 
a block are:
<p>
•   its header, which includes metadata, such as a unique 
block reference number, the time the block was created 
and a link back to the previous block
<p>
Given the latest block, it is possible to access all previous 
blocks linked together in the chain, so a blockchain 
database retains the complete history of all assets and 
instructions executed since the very first one – making 
its data verifiable and independently auditable. As the 
number of participants grows, it becomes harder for 
malicious actors to overcome the verification activities of 
the majority. Therefore the network becomes increasingly 
robust and secure. Indeed, blockchain solutions are being 
planned to protect data from the UK’s nuclear power 
stations, flood-defence mechanisms and other critical 
infrastructure.23
<p>
•   its content, usually a validated list of digital assets and 
<p>
instruction statements, such as transactions made, 
their amounts and the addresses of the parties to those 
transactions.22
<p>
When a miner solves 
the cryptographic 
problem, the 
discovery is 
announced to the 
rest of the network.
<p>
The new block is put 
in the network so 
that miners can 
verify if its 
transactions are 
legitimate. 
Veriﬁcation is 
accomplished by 
completing complex 
cryptographic 
computations.
<p>
Within ten minutes 
of Bob initiating
the transaction,
he and Alice each 
receive  the ﬁrst 
conﬁrmation that 
the bitcoin was 
signed over to her.
<p>
The algorithm 
rewards the
winning miner with 
25 bitcoins, and the 
new block is added 
to the front of
the blockchain.
Each block joins
the prior block so
a chain is made – 
the blockchain.
<p>
All the transactions 
in the block are now 
fulﬁlled and Alice 
gets paid.

private blockchains?
Like many other types of database, blockchains can be 
public or private. The Bitcoin network is public (also 
called “permission-less”) because anyone can read or 
write data from or to the ledger if they are running the 
appropriate Bitcoin software. Private blockchains, on 
the other hand, are networks where the participants are 
known a priori and have permission to update the ledger. 
Participants may come from the same organisation or 
from different organisations within an industry sector 
where the relationships between them are governed by 
informal arrangements, formal contracts or confidentiality 
agreements. 
<p>
In the absence of trust, public blockchains typically require 
additional mechanisms to arbitrate disputes among 
participants and protect the integrity of the data. This 
involves added complexity because there is no central 
authority to arbitrate in a decentralised network. In the 
Bitcoin blockchain, for example, new transactions can 
only be added to the blockchain after a participant on the 
network solves a complex mathematical problem, known 
as a ‘proof-of-work’. This process is called ‘mining’. The 
effort miners have to expend on finding a solution to this 
mathematical problem acts as a sign that the transactions 
are valid, even though the miners may not know one 
another.
<p>
What alternatives are there to the Bitcoin blockchain?
Blockchains come in many different types. As well as 
the Bitcoin blockchain, a number of other independent 
blockchains have emerged in recent years. None has 
yet achieved the same scale as Bitcoin but they do offer 
other benefits, such as increased speed, larger data 
capacities, different consensus methods or more advanced 
functionality. Litecoin, for example, is a smaller competitor 
of Bitcoin but offers faster transaction times.24 The Ripple 
Transaction Protocol is a simpler type of blockchain 
providing instant, certified and low cost international 
payments targeted at banks and non-bank financial 
services companies.25 Transactions on Ripple’s distributed 
ledger are validated by consensus rather than using a 
proof-of-work approach like Bitcoin because a level of trust 
is assumed between the parties to a transaction. 
<p>
Ethereum, on the other hand, is an open-source, crowdfunded project, much like the Bitcoin blockchain but which 
allows a network of peers to administer their own ‘smart 
contracts’ – short computer programmes carried on the 
blockchain that execute their instructions once certain 
criteria have been met.26 It is these smart contracts that 
have the potential to transform business processes in many 
industry sectors. For example, Figure 2 illustrates how 
Bitcoin-based smart contracts could enhance transparency 
in investment banking.

providing ‘Blockchain-as-a-Service’ (BaaS) on their existing 
cloud platforms.27 BaaS enables developers from any 
organisation to deploy private or semi-public blockchains 
using Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum and other protocols, 
and experiment with decentralised applications without 
incurring the capital costs associated with setting up their 
own networks.
<p>
What elements are common to all blockchains?
•  A blockchain is digitally distributed across a
<p>
number of computers in almost real-time: the
blockchain is decentralised, and a copy of the entire
record is available to all users and participants of a
peer-to-peer network. This eliminates the need for
central authorities, such as banks, as well as trusted
intermediaries, such as brokerage firms.
<p>
•  A blockchain uses many participants in the network
<p>
to reach consensus: the participants use their
computers to authenticate and verify each new block
– for example, to ensure that the same transaction
does not occur more than once. New blocks are
only adopted by the network once a majority of its
participants agree that they are valid.
<p>
•  A blockchain uses cryptography and digital
<p>
signatures to prove identity: transactions can be
traced back to cryptographic identities, which are
theoretically anonymous, but can be tied back to reallife identities with some reverse engineering.
<p>
•  A blockchain has mechanisms to make it hard (but
not impossible) to change historical records: even
though all data can be read and new data can be
written, data that exists earlier in a blockchain cannot
in theory be altered except where the rules embedded
within the protocol allow such changes – for instance,
by requiring more than 50 per cent of the network to
agree on a change.
<p>
•  A blockchain is time-stamped: transactions on the
<p>
blockchain are time-stamped, making it useful for
tracking and verifying information.
<p>
•  A blockchain is programmable: instructions
<p>
embedded within blocks, such as “if” this “then” do
that “else” do this, allow transactions or other actions
to be carried out only if certain conditions are met, and
can be accompanied by additional digital data.
<p>
Blockchains come in many 
different types. As well as the 
Bitcoin blockchain, a number of 
other independent blockchains have 
emerged in recent years. None 
has yet achieved the same scale 
as Bitcoin but they do offer other 
benefits, such as increased speed, 
larger data capacities, different 
consensus methods or more 
advanced functionality.

<p>
“ [The] Bitcoin protocol and network today is that 
foundational layer. It is [a] value transfer network. 
Beyond that, it is a core, backbone security service 
securing contracts, physical and digital property, 
equities, bonds, robot AI and an enormous wave of 
applications which have not yet been conceived.”28
<p>
Jeff Garzik, Bitcoin core developer and CEO, Dunvegan Space Systems
<p>
The problem for many organisations at the centre of 
traditional value-exchange processes, especially banks, or 
credit card and other types of payment company, is that 
blockchain technology is a double-edged sword. 
<p>
Public blockchains, like Bitcoin, Litecoin and others, 
threaten disintermediation as they empower peer-topeer networks. The value they create is taken away from 
central institutions and returned mainly to consumers. 
However, early predictions of the demise of our global 
banking system or national governments seem hasty 
and premature in the cold light of day. The reality is that 
while many transactions will benefit from a decentralised 
approach, many others will still need to be handled via an 
intermediary, which can, despite additional complexities 
and regulation, veto suspect transactions, provide 
guarantees and indemnities, and deliver a range of 
associated products and services that consumers cannot 
yet access on the blockchain.
<p>
How does a blockchain deliver value?
The way in which many established transaction processing 
systems work is very different from the decentralised and 
distributed nature of a blockchain. For certain applications, 
the current model of value creation is likely to be bettered 
by faster, cheaper, more reliable and transparent processes 
enabled by the blockchain. This is illustrated in Figure 3. 
However, Jeff Garzik, one of Bitcoin’s core developers, 
cautions against trying to do too much with a blockchain: 
“Do not try to stuff every feature into the Bitcoin protocol. 
Let it do what it does best. Build systems on top of Bitcoin 
which use its strengths…. Putting all the world’s coffee 
transactions, and all the world’s stock trades, and all the 
world’s Internet of Things device samplings, on the Bitcoin 
blockchain seems misguided”.29 
<p>
There are clearly both practical and philosophical limits 
to the scope of applications amenable to blockchain 
approaches. But with a little careful thought, linking users 
and organisations directly together through a shared 
ledger and distributing processing across a network, 
we should be able to remove the friction that makes 
existing transactions slow and expensive. And because 
a blockchain breaks many of the rules and conventions 
that traditional business processes are built upon, it forces 
organisations to think differently about how they create 
value.

<p>
There are considerable opportunities for organisations that 
adopt blockchain technology internally, using bespoke 
blockchains or so-called ‘side-chains’, which provide some 
interoperability with public blockchains, like Bitcoin, while 
adding new functionality.30 Perhaps the most significant 
opportunity, though, comes from blockchains that link 
currently disparate parts of one enterprise together or 
even many different organisations from within the same 
sector.

<p>
“ There have been a few different start-ups trying to 
create basically their own blockchains with specific 
use-cases. In our view we feel that kind of defeats 
the purpose of having a network itself because it just 
recreates silos.”31
<p>
Tim Swanson, head of research at R3CEV
<p>
As the blockchain ecosystem evolves and different usecases emerge, organisations in all industry sectors will face 
a complex and potentially controversial array of issues, as 
well as new dependencies. 
<p>
Awareness and understanding
The principal challenge associated with blockchain is a lack 
of awareness of the technology, especially in sectors other 
than banking, and a widespread lack of understanding 
of how it works. This is hampering investment and the 
exploration of ideas. As George Howard, contributor 
to Forbes Media and Entertainment, says about the 
music business, “Artists – visual, musical, or otherwise 
– really must educate themselves about these emerging
technologies, or suffer the fate of being exploited by those
who do”.32 This is a message that applies to organisations,
also.
<p>
Organisation 
The blockchain creates most value for organisations 
when they work together on areas of shared pain or 
shared opportunity – especially problems particular to 
each industry sector. The problem with many current 
approaches, though, is that they remain stove-piped: 
organisations are developing their own blockchains 
and applications to run on top of them. In any one 
industry sector, many different chains are therefore being 
developed by many different organisations to many 
different standards. This defeats the purpose of distributed 
ledgers, fails to harness network effects and can be less 
efficient than current approaches.

A blockchain represents a total shift away from the 
traditional ways of doing things – even for industries 
that have already seen significant transformation from 
digital technologies. It places trust and authority in a 
decentralised network rather than in a powerful central 
institution. And for most, this loss of control can be deeply 
unsettling. 
<p>
It has been estimated that a blockchain is about 80 per 
cent business process change and 20 per cent technology 
implementation.33 This means that a more imaginative 
approach is needed to understand opportunities and also 
how things will change.
<p>
Key questions every leader should ask: 
•  Where can we pilot new blockchain approaches on the
<p>
edges of our business?
<p>
•  Who will be most affected by blockchain
implementations and are they supportive?
<p>
•  Which areas of our business are likely to be most
<p>
disrupted?
<p>
•  Have we thought about impacts on our strategy,
<p>
organisational structure, business processes,
governance, talent and legacy systems?
<p>
Cost and efficiency
The speed and effectiveness with which blockchain 
networks can execute peer-to-peer transactions comes 
at a high aggregate cost, which is greater for some types 
of blockchain than others. This inefficiency arises because 
each node performs the same tasks as every other node 
on its own copy of the data in an attempt to be the first 
to find a solution. For the Bitcoin network, for example, 
which uses a proof-of-work approach in lieu of trusting 
participants in the network, the total running costs 
associated with validating and sharing transactions on the 
public ledger are estimated to be as much as $600 million 
a year and rising.34 This total does not include the capital 
costs associated with acquiring specialist mining hardware. 
<p>
Blockchains are something of a productivity paradox, 
therefore. At the scale of the entire network the process is 
significantly productivity enhancing, but requires a certain 
‘critical mass’ of nodes. Yet, even so, individual nodes can 
work extremely hard and may not contribute very much to 
the network overall. 
<p>
Therefore, decisions about implementing blockchain 
applications need to be carefully thought through. The 
returns to individual processing nodes – either individuals 
in a public blockchain or organisations in a sector-wide 
blockchain – may diminish as the network grows in size. 
This means that blockchain applications must harness 
network effects to deliver value to consumers or to sectors 
at large.
<p>
Key questions every leader should ask: 
•  What is the business case for implementing a
<p>
blockchain? How do we make it pay?
<p>
•  What are the bottlenecks in the processes we are
<p>
replacing with the blockchain?
<p>
•  What are the main drivers of cost in our implementation
<p>
of the blockchain?
<p>
•  How can the cost and processing load be shared among
<p>
participating organisations?

Regulations have always struggled to keep up with 
advances in technology. Indeed, some technologies like 
the Bitcoin blockchain bypass regulation completely to 
tackle inefficiencies in conventional intermediated payment 
networks. One of the other challenges of the blockchain 
approach, which was also one of its original motivations, is 
that it reduces oversight. 
<p>
Security and privacy
While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer pseudonymity 
(Bitcoin transactions are tied to ‘wallets’ rather than to 
individuals), many potential applications of the blockchain 
require smart transactions and contracts to be indisputably 
linked to known identities, and thus raise important 
questions about privacy and the security of the data stored 
and accessible on the shared ledger.
<p>
Centralised systems, particularly in financial services, also 
“act as shock absorbers in times of crisis” despite their 
challenges and bottlenecks.35 Decentralised networks 
can be much less resilient to shocks, which can impact 
participants directly, unless careful thought is given to their 
design. 
<p>
There is thus a strong argument for blockchain applications 
to work within existing regulatory structures not outside 
of them, but this means that regulators in all industries 
have to understand the technology and its impact on the 
businesses and consumers in their sector. 
<p>
Some argue that while no technology is completely secure, 
no one has yet managed to break the encryption and 
decentralised architecture of a blockchain.36 Identities 
created within a blockchain would be unique and offer 
a higher level of assurance that the party was who they 
claim to be. But these claims do not take away from the 
need for every organisation adopting the technology to 
consider how privacy and security can inform the design. 
In particular, driving public acceptance of blockchain 
applications will likely mean proactively framing the 
discussion of privacy around concepts of value, security 
and trust. 
<p>
Key questions every leader should ask: 
•  How do current regulations impact our application of

<p>
“ We always overestimate the change that will occur in 
the next two years and underestimate the change that 
will occur in the next ten. Don’t let yourself be lulled 
into inaction.”
<p>
Bill Gates, technologist and philanthropist
<p>
Today, performing an online transaction – such as paying 
for goods or services – is almost impossible without 
involving a third party, such as a bank or credit card 
company. When these transactions work, they are taken 
for granted. When they fail, the complexities, fragmented 
nature and opacity of the systems used to handle the 
exchange are often exposed. 
<p>
Some bold predictions suggest that the institutions at the 
centre of current transaction systems will cease to exist in 
just a few years. Others are more conservative, positing 
a relatively low impact in the short term for blockchain 
applications other than payments. The reality is likely to be 
somewhere between these two extremes. And different 
markets will also move at different speeds, particularly 
where the role of central institutions is less dominant. 
<p>
Jonathan Swift, author of Gulliver’s Travels, said, “Vision 
is the art of seeing what is invisible to others” and this 
quote sums up what is needed from businesses today. As 
the blockchain ecosystem steadily builds, the prospects of 
more significant change occurring within the next decade 
will increase. Organisations that fail to create a vision 
and adopt a ‘wait-and-see’ attitude towards blockchain 
are unlikely to develop the expertise or break down 
the organisational and cultural barriers needed to work 
effectively with this new technology. Nor are they likely 
to engage their peers or stakeholders in discussions about 
how the technology may affect their industry at large.
<p>
For start-ups and entrepreneurs, interest in the blockchain 
space is growing rapidly. For legacy organisations, 
particularly large multinationals, the situation is more 
challenging. These types of organisation can be stirred 
into action by identifying specific opportunities where 
the existing modes of value exchange in the sector create 
bottlenecks and then analysing how a distributed ledger 
might help address them. By solving concrete problems, 
organisations can more effectively identify the technical, 
organisational, cultural and talent changes necessary to 
realise new benefits – and then scale what works. 
<p>
Beyond the tactical changes for organisations, it is 
important to consider the potential magnitude of business 
and process change caused by a shift onto sectorwide blockchain platforms. Engaging with like-minded 
organisations to develop and foster these collaborations 
and prepare for change is vital. Understanding the risks 
and level of disruption beforehand is also key to the design 
of effective systems.
<p>
Ultimately, the blockchain is not just about 
cryptocurrencies and faster peer-to-peer payments. It 
is also part of an ecosystem of advanced but fledgling 
technologies, including artificial intelligence, robotics and 
crowdsourcing, that look set to play a fundamental role 
in the future of commerce and society. Blockchain will 
affect the way that individuals and organisations interact, 
the way that businesses collaborate with one another, the 
transparency of processes and data, and, ultimately, the 
productivity and sustainability of our economy.

Blockchain applications in banking
<p>
“ I don’t know what’s going to succeed. 
What I’m certain of is that we are going to see 
blockchain solutions, peer-to-peer solutions 
emerging in our industry and we want to be  
close to that development.”1
<p>
Simon McNamara, Chief Administrative Officer, RBS
<p>
A recent article from Let’s Talk Payments lists 26 
separate banks currently exploring the use of blockchain 
technology for payments processing.2 R3CEV, the New 
York start-up, says that it is working with 42 banks to 
explore a common set of standards and best practices 
with a view to creating commercial applications using a 
blockchain.3 
<p>
This doesn’t sound like an industry on the ropes. In fact, 
the race to develop applications highlights a sector-wide 
desire for change in traditional financial systems. In this 
fast-moving environment, no one wants to be left behind. 
<p>
The thinking around blockchain concepts to facilitate 
the exchange of money is well-established. Indeed, this 
is the original use-case for digital currencies like Bitcoin. 
However, there are further opportunities for banks to 
use the blockchain technology to improve other services 
and compliance activities less likely to be subject to 
disintermediation.
<p>
Example: Know Your Customer 
<p>
What are the current bottlenecks or issues?
Global efforts to prevent money laundering and the 
financing of terrorism are incredibly expensive for financial 
firms to maintain. In 2014, it was estimated that global 
spending on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance 
alone amounted to $10 billion.4 The banks are coming 
under pressure from investors and analysts to reduce 
costs, but many expect the budgets for their compliance 
teams to increase in the coming years rather than 
decrease.5, 6 
<p>
In addition to the financial burden, Know Your Customer 
(KYC) requests can also delay transactions, taking 30 to 
50 days to complete to a satisfactory level.7 Current KYC 
processes also entail substantial duplication of effort 
between firms.
<p>
While annual compliance costs are high, there are 
also large penalties for failing to follow KYC guidelines 
properly. Since 2009, regulatory fines, particularly in the 
US, have followed an upward trend, with record-breaking 
fines levied during 2015.8 
<p>
How the blockchain could help
The sharing of customer information is already starting 
to take place. For example, SWIFT recently established 
its KYC Registry, with 1,125 member banks sharing KYC 
documentation, but this amounts to only 16 per cent of 
the 7,000 banks in their network.9
<p>
The use of a distributed ledger system, such as a 
blockchain, however, could unlock advantages by 
automating processes and thus reducing compliance 
errors. A blockchain-based registry would not only remove 
the duplication of effort in carrying out KYC checks, 
but the ledger would also enable encrypted updates to 
client details to be distributed to all banks in near realtime. In addition, the ledger would provide a historical 
record of all documents shared and compliance activities 
undertaken for each client. This record could be used to 
provide evidence that a bank has acted in accordance 
with the requirements placed upon it should regulators 
ask for clarification. It would also be of particular use 
in identifying entities attempting to create fraudulent 
histories. Subject to the provisions of data protection 
regulation, the data within it could even be analysed 
by the banks to spot irregularities or foul play – directly 
targeting criminal activity.
<p>
Although many people perceive applications on the 
blockchain to offer anonymity, the technology can actually 
be used to cement real-world identities to cryptographic 
identities in the database. Companies like I/O Digital, Sho 
Card, Uniquid, Onename, Ascribe Gmbh and Trustatom 
all offer businesses, including banks, the ability to scan 
customer documents and identity information and then 
generate private and public keys to seal them before the 
data is encrypted and sent to the blockchain.10 The FinTech 
startups Chainalysis and IdentifyMind Global help banks 
comply with KYC and AML regulations as they consider 
whether to provide banking services to Bitcoin-related 
businesses.11 
<p>
Given the expectation that banks will increase their use 
of blockchain applications in areas such as transaction 
settlement and payment systems, the use of a common 
distributed ledger for KYC checks might also offer the 
opportunity to link many banks to enforce compliance. 
In the Netherlands, for example, Dutch banks are 
partnering with Innopay in an attempt to enrol a number 
of other banks in a common digital identity service.12 This 
interoperability, combined with the application of smart 
contracts could be used to automate some aspects of the 
compliance process. For instance, transactions could only 
be permitted to occur with parties for whom adequate KYC 
evidence exists on the blockchain.
<p>
Implications
The burden of KYC compliance could be significantly 
reduced through the use of a shared database of client 
background documentation. In some respects, use of a 
blockchain for settlements and payments creates an even 
stronger case for tighter controls around KYC. 
<p>
Under the strain of regulation, creaking legacy IT systems 
and a tight market for technical talent, asking banks 
to make wholesale changes to their business models is 
difficult. Pilot programmes and proof-of-concept activities 
could allow banks to explore faster, cheaper, better ways of 
facilitating payments and improving KYC compliance. They 
could also help regulators stay on top of changes in process 
and technology.

Blockchain applications in insurance 
<p>
“ When I saw what the fundamental principles 
of the blockchain provided, it was just patently 
obvious to me that it would make sense around 
reducing fraud related instances of valuables.”1
<p>
Leanne Kemp, Chief Executive Officer, Everledger 
<p>
Insurers, like banks, are intermediaries and, at first glance, 
there is great potential for insurers to use blockchain 
technology to streamline payments of premiums and 
claims. 
<p>
In addition, blockchain technologies could support the 
significant digital transformation underway in the industry 
because much of this transformation relies on data. For 
example, actuaries and underwriters are using the everexpanding universe of data to build models that more 
accurately estimate risk and price it accordingly. Arguably 
the most exciting example of this trend is in telematics: 
insurers are using data from sensors to price motor risk 
more accurately, reducing the premiums of young safe 
drivers, and this technology is spreading to other types of 
cover, such as home insurance. 
<p>
However, unlike in banking, the general view among 
the industry is one of ‘wait and see’. “Insurers do not 
necessarily need a current Bitcoin strategy to remain 
competitive,” says one observer, “but should nonetheless 
continue to monitor the space and consider it as an area 
for potential innovation”.2
<p>
Early activity has tended to focus on optimising current 
ways of working within organisations rather than on 
investigating the potential of a blockchain to address 
industry-wide problems and opportunities. 
<p>
Everledger, for example, uses the blockchain to create a 
distributed ledger that records details of precious stones 
like diamonds.3 This ledger allows insurers (as well as 
potential purchasers) to check the history of any individual 
stone, including previous claims that have been made, 
helping insurers prevent, detect and counter fraud.
<p>
Example: Claims handling
<p>
What are the current bottlenecks or issues?
For customers, insurance contracts are typically complex 
and difficult to understand because of the legal language 
used. In addition, when accidents or crimes happen, 
customers can often be faced with a complex and drawnout claims process. 
<p>
From the insurer’s perspective, the industry is facing 
ever-tighter regulation and a growing threat from fraud 
– whether from small-claims fraud by individuals or more 
serious and organised fraud spanning multiple insurers in 
the industry. The Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB) is a not-forprofit body set up to tackle organised crime affecting the 
UK general insurance industry. In a typical motor insurance
scam, for example, drivers deliberately stage or cause an 
accident or even pretend to have had an accident, and 
claims are then made by the various criminals involved. 
These so-called ‘crash for cash’ scams cost the industry 
around £400 million a year.4 Where claims are made 
against multiple policies held by different insurers, it 
becomes difficult to detect the fraud unless cross-industry 
data is shared. 
<p>
How the blockchain could help
Smart contracts powered by a blockchain could provide 
customers and insurers with the means to manage 
claims in a transparent, responsive and irrefutable 
manner. Contracts and claims could be recorded onto 
a blockchain and validated by the network, ensuring 
only valid claims are paid. For example, the blockchain 
would reject multiple claims for one accident because 
the network would know that a claim had already been 
made. Smart contracts would also enforce the claims – for 
instance, triggering payments automatically when certain 
conditions are met (and validated).

Edgelogic provides a bridge between the Internet of Things 
– devices connected to the internet – and a blockchain, 
conceivably allowing accidents or problems detected by
sensors in the home to trigger a set of instructions that 
automatically transfer cash for repairs from an insurer.5
<p>
Adopting a common blockchain across the sector could 
create a step-change in value in the insurance industry: 
claims-handling could become more efficient and 
streamlined, resulting in an improved customer experience. 
Such an approach could also help to reduce further, if not 
entirely prevent, fraud if identity management was also 
enforced on the blockchain – meaning that criminals could 
no longer crash for cash, or exploit the current challenges 
of sharing data unless their methods for obscuring identities 
became significantly more sophisticated.
<p>
Implications
A common claims-handling platform would still make it 
possible for individual insurers to compete for customers, 
offering a range of products and prices by virtue of the 
smart contracts they set up. Moreover, a blockchain could 
allow the industry as a whole to streamline its processing 
and offer a better user experience for customers who 
have to make a claim. Simultaneously, storing claims and 
customer information on a blockchain would cut down 
fraudulent activity – it would certainly make it much harder 
for criminals to mask their identities or attempt to claim 
more than once. Indeed, in many respects, with projects 
like the IFB now long-established, the general insurance 
industry faces a smaller cultural and organisational hill to 
climb than does banking and other sectors.

Blockchain applications in the public sector 
<p>
“ The most efficient way to produce anything is 
to bring together under one management as 
many as possible of the activities needed to 
turn out the product.” 
<p>
Peter Drucker
<p>
The public sector is a complex machine – centralised in 
respect of its responsibility for governance and public 
service delivery, yet fragmented and often disconnected 
in terms of its organisational structure and ability to share 
data.
<p>
The effects of long-running austerity cut deep – 
reductions in departmental budgets offer a stark choice 
to central and local government bodies alike: sweeping 
cuts, shrinking headcount and reduced services on the 
one hand or wholesale transformation of service delivery 
on the other. 
<p>
Blockchains could be used to address inefficiencies in 
current systems and increase the effectiveness of public 
service delivery. For example, a blockchain could serve 
as the official registry for government-licensed assets or 
intellectual property owned by citizens and businesses, 
such as houses, vehicles and patents. A blockchain could 
facilitate voting in elections, ensuring that each eligible 
person uses only one vote. A blockchain could also help 
in back-office functions, to coordinate and streamline 
tendering and purchasing across departments, agencies, 
and other arms-length bodies. In all cases, a blockchain 
could reduce fraud and error while delivering big benefits 
in terms of efficiency and productivity.
<p>
While interest in the technology appears to be growing, 
public sector applications using the blockchain are, as yet, 
rare. The government in Honduras, for example, kicked-off 
a project last year with Factom to reduce fraud in its public 
land registry by moving data onto a distributed ledger, but 
this project has apparently stalled.1 And BitHealth, a US 
start-up, is investigating use of the Bitcoin blockchain to 
store and transmit healthcare records securely to make it 
easier for patients to receive treatment wherever they are 
in the world.2 These are early days, though, and almost 
every part of the public sector could benefit in some way 
from blockchain technology. 
<p>
Example: Asset registry
<p>
What are the current bottlenecks or issues?
All land or property must be registered with the 
appropriate public sector body if it is bought, gifted, 
inherited, mortgaged or received in exchange for other 
property.3 In November 2015, the number of residential 
property transactions in the UK exceeded 100,000, and 
the number of non-residential transactions was nearly 
9,000.4 Across the financial year 2014-15, the total 
number of residential property transactions completed 
with a value of £40,000 or above was over 1.2 million.5 
<p>
The size of the housing market makes it costly to keep 
track of the many property transactions that accumulate 
over time. And for buyers and sellers, information about 
the ownership of properties can only be accessed or 
updated via the central register held by the public sector. 
<p>
High property prices also make houses attractive to 
fraudsters who may use forged documents to transfer 
someone else’s property into their own name or to 
raise a mortgage on someone else’s property. Once 
they have raised money by mortgaging the property 
without the owner’s knowledge they disappear without 
making repayments, leaving the owner to deal with the 
consequences.6
<p>
Current measures to prevent property fraud have stopped 
fraudulent applications on properties worth more than 
£74 million.7 The challenge, though, is that property 
fraud is not easily detected so the responsibility falls on 
all parties, including home owners, the government, 
solicitors and mortgage lenders. And with interest rates 
likely to rise in the future, the level of fraud may increase – 
leaving more people to pick up the bill.8

<p>
How the blockchain could help
Property transactions could be handled on a blockchain 
in a similar way to how payments between parties are 
handled using digital currencies like Bitcoin. However, 
instead of assuming that each ‘coin’ is the same, it would 
be possible to associate a unique house or piece of land 
with a particular coin, or fraction of a coin, and exchange 
it just like in any other transaction using digital currency. 
The entire transaction history of the property could then 
be followed through the blockchain. This concept is known 
as ‘coloured coins’ because the coins are ‘coloured’ to 
represent a specific asset, such as a house.9
<p>
In the blockchain, assets are held by the owners of private 
keys, the cryptographic ‘identity’ created when a user first 
registers for the blockchain. The title deeds and identity 
documents proving ownership do not themselves need 
to be stored on the blockchain. Instead, they can be 
‘hashed’ – a mathematical transformation that converts 
long documents of text and other characters to a much 
shorter, fixed-length string of text and numbers. The hash is 
unique to the original document and can be stored with the 
coloured coin on the blockchain in much less space. 
<p>
Using smart contracts, asset exchange could also follow 
specific instructions encoded as part of the transaction to 
be executed automatically once agreed criteria have been 
met.
<p>
Implications
A blockchain-based approach to registering property titles 
could increase the efficiency of transaction processing and 
reduce, if not entirely prevent, property fraud. 
<p>
A property registry could be delivered via a centrally 
administered public blockchain, which, although replicating 
large elements of the current registration process, would 
simultaneously provide enhanced security against fraud, 
increased resilience and improved transparency – since 
the historical transaction records could be read by the 
public. A blockchain could also help in resolving disputes 
over property ownership since each transaction would be 
verified and stored in the distributed ledger.
<p>
For the registration authorities, a blockchain thus provides 
a way of combining many processes and systems into one, 
increasing efficiency through distributed processing and 
thus reducing cost.

media industry 
<p>
“We are at an amazing point in history for artists. 
A revolution is going to happen, and next year 
it’s going to take over. It’s the ability of artists to 
have the control and the say of what they do with 
their music at large. The answer to this is in the 
blockchain.”1
<p>
Imogen Heap, British singer and songwriter
<p>
Digital technologies have transformed content production 
and distribution in the global entertainment and media 
industry over the last two decades. The market is forecast 
to continue to grow over the next five years, and is 
currently estimated to be worth just over $2 trillion.2 
<p>
Acute challenges remain, though, especially relating 
to the way in which digital content can be copied and 
freely distributed on the internet, and how artists are 
compensated when their materials are used or bought 
through legitimate channels. 
<p>
In the news media, for example, several newspapers 
keep their digital content behind paywalls, charging fees 
to access articles and stories online, but they have had 
varying degrees of success. One of the latest experiments 
involves micropayments – payments by consumers of 
very small sums of money to read individual articles or 
even portions of articles – sufficient to make a difference 
to rights holders but not enough to put off consumers. 
Although this approach does not use a blockchain, it is 
a sign of the interest that now permeates the industry in 
finding commercial models that work for content creators, 
consumers and corporations alike.
<p>
Blockchain technology could help to resolve a number 
of these challenges by connecting authors, musicians 
and videographers directly with consumers, as well as 
by making the organisations at the heart of the industry 
operate more efficiently. The opportunity goes beyond 
simply enforcing payment for content, it could help digital 
rights to be identified and managed more effectively 
across the industry, and appropriate compensation paid to 
the right artists and content owners. 
<p>
For example, in an industry that has already undergone 
significant digital disruption, many musicians are hopeful 
that blockchain technology can help them reinvent the 
music business.
<p>
Example: Royalty payments in the music industry
<p>
What are the current bottlenecks or issues?
Despite the industry at large being in rude health, the 
inner workings of the music business are struggling 
to keep up with digital technologies. The industry has 
traditionally been highly intermediated: artists’ contracts 
written years ago do not necessarily reflect the way that 
music is now consumed, and royalty payments depend 
upon airplay statistics gathered by music labels and 
copyright databases maintained by licensing bodies.4 
Streaming services are also shaking up the traditional 
business model since many earn their revenues through 
advertising rather than from selling music. The system 
works increasingly well for consumers, but such is its 
complexity and lack of transparency that earning money 
as an artist is fraught with difficulty.
<p>
How the blockchain could help 
A blockchain could be used to store a cryptographic ‘hash’ 
of the original digital music file, associating it with the 
addresses – and, potentially, the identities – of the people 
involved in its creation. The blockchain could also store the 
instructions, in the form of a smart contract, for how the 
artists would be compensated for the song or music.

<p>
The British artist, Imogen Heap, who released her song, 
Tiny Human, using the blockchain, explains that the 
technology enables rules to be included that set out how 
and where the music could be used – putting artists in 
control of their content.6
<p>
A number of start-ups are beginning to explore this space. 
Ascribe, for instance, is a company using blockchain 
technology and machine learning – a form of artificial 
intelligence – to ensure artists and content producers are 
being paid fees for the use of their intellectual property.7 
Ujo is a service that uses Ethereum’s blockchain platform to 
allow musicians and other artists to record and publish rules 
on how they want their music to be used, which aims to 
solve global royalty payment and licensing problems across 
the industry.8 And Bittunes is using blockchain technology 
to help independent artists flourish.9 
<p>
Implications
Widespread adoption of blockchain platforms could trigger 
a new wave of transformation in the music business yet 
remain compatible with contemporary models of digital 
music distribution, such as downloads and streaming. 
<p>
From the consumers’ perspective, very little would change, 
potentially, except that a blockchain would ensure that 
copyright theft and illegal file-sharing become all but 
impossible. The main shift, though, occurs in the way 
that artists are able to manage their intellectual property, 
ensuring that the way their content is used and paid for is 
controlled. 
<p>
For music labels and licensing bodies, there is an 
opportunity to be on the leading edge of change by 
working with artists and distributors to establish new 
standards and ways of working that reach right across 
the industry. A common blockchain platform, employing 
identity management and smart contracts, locks in rules 
for how revenue flows from consumer to artist every time 
a piece of content is played or streamed, reducing the 
costs associated with collecting and managing statistics, 
maintaining copyright databases and distributing royalty 
payments. It could also enable new business models, such 
as micropayments, being considered elsewhere in the 
media industry.

Blockchain applications in energy trading
<p>
“ Firms are dealing with greater requirements for reporting, 
transparency, and dissemination of data. Costs have gone 
up and revenues have gone down. This technology really 
gets to the core of all those issues.”
<p>
Blythe Masters – CEO, Digital Asset Holdings
<p>
Picture a trade floor five years in the future. The robotic 
trader managing one of the gas desks is about to 
execute a physical natural gas trade with an industrial 
customer. One of the robot’s trading algorithms scans 
available market interest and optimises its search for 
the best deal to meet the customer’s volume and tenor 
requirements for a given period. Once the robot’s 
proposed deal terms are approved by the customer, 
the trade is executed and recorded on the blockchain. 
The deal terms are automatically confirmed and 
nomination information is recorded on the blockchain 
and available to the pipeline shipping the gas. As gas 
flows throughout the month, physical settlement 
occurs daily with payment initiated immediately. 
All activity added to the blockchain is readily available 
to the seller, buyer, pipeline and bank. Physical title of 
the gas is also conveyed directly via the blockchain.
<p>
This example, possible using technologies available 
today, demonstrates one of the real powers of the 
blockchain. The elimination of inefficient, error prone 
and costly back office processes such as confirmations, 
actualisation of volumes and numerous forms of 
reconciliation. If all parties to a transaction had access 
to the same verified transaction record, available 
through a distributed database, the impact on the 
speed and costs of transacting would be immense. 
In addition, credit risk could be reduced to almost zero, 
through faster settlement times and lower collateral 
requirements. Blockchain technology has the potential 
to transform the entire deal life cycle minimising human 
intervention from trade execution to payment.
<p>
Smart contracts
Smart contracts are one application of 
blockchain technology that will impact all 
commodity market participants in the not too 
distant future. Smart contracts are effectively 
programmes which are loaded into, and sit 
alongside traditional transactions within 
a blockchain, that can automatically execute 
pre-definable code when called (for example, 
automatically executing the terms of a contract 
when trigger events occur). Think of a digital 
confirmation containing embedded IF..
THEN statements that could automatically be 
executed if certain price or volume conditions 
are met. The impact on transacting cost will 
be significant. The important thing about 
smart contracts is they reside in a decentralised 
system accessible to anyone, that doesn’t 
require any intermediary party.
<p>
But blockchain technologies will not simply make 
the current markets more efficient. They have the 
potential to radically disrupt and open up the energy 
markets in ways people have not yet even considered. 
Boundaries between asset classes will blur as cash, 
energy products and other commodities, from 
industrial components to apples could all become 
digital assets trading inter-operably. If more value 
can be derived by not restricting activity to a single 
asset class, then that is where the market will go. 
Blockchain will provide the platform.

There are many ways the blockchain will impact 
commodity market participants that we did not begin

adoption of blockchain based applications. The cost 
and nature of fee based transacting will be impacted. 
The role of regulators and ability for market participants 
to meet compliance obligations will need to be 
examined in careful detail, and in some cases regulation 
may ultimately evolve in alignment with new ways of 
working. The issue of anonymity and payments will need 
to be addressed, as will the ultimate link between the 
digital conveyance of value over the blockchain and the 
actual conveyance of value through an acceptable means 
of payment (i.e. currency).
<p>
If certain regulatory hurdles can be overcome (and this 
will be no small task), access to markets will open up  
significantly. Marketplaces will consolidate, and 
accessibility will explode, significantly compressing 
margins at the transactional level. Trading activity may 
increasingly involve direct transactions with members of 
the public, or public ‘consortiums’. Further still, the role 
of the trader itself may be disintermediated as end users 
transact (organisations and/or individuals, and again 
likely in groups) directly with suppliers. What is the role 
of an energy trader in a world where a smart home hub 
can connect to a global energy market and continuously 
balance your home’s energy use in real time by sourcing 
electricity or natural gas at market rates from a source 
supplier?
<p>
The examples above are by no means exhaustive, but 
they provide some hint of the potential disruptive power 
of widespread adoption of blockchain technologies.

The value of the blockchain
There is good reason why the blockchain is 
of such high interest to so many financial 
market participants. The blockchain promises 
a transactional platform that is highly secure, 
low cost, fast, with lower incidents of 
error, and the possibility of reducing capital 
requirements. It essentially allows companies 
to automate more while processing greater 
volumes of data cheaper with fewer people at 
lower cost and risk. This is hard to ignore.
<p>
How the blockchain could help
For energy market participants, the value derived 
through the application of blockchain applications is 
compelling. Initially, it is unlikely that an entire market, 
commodity or deal life cycle will become blockchain 
enabled all at once. We will likely see pilot programmes 
with a select group of market participants centered on 
specific functional applications such as payments or 
smart contracts. Additional potential benefits include:
<p>
•  Increases speed of exchange, which minimises
<p>
transacting backlog and overall costs
<p>
•  Improves availability and reliability of data
•  Improves auditability as records are verified in near
<p>
real-time
<p>
•  Can be used to convey title of physical commodity
<p>
seamlessly between market participants
<p>
What are the current bottlenecks or issues?
Transacting in energy commodities is currently 
inefficient. Intermediaries and complex processes 
impact the speed of exchanging critical data. Issues that 
blockchain enabled applications could address include:
<p>
•  Removal or reduction of frictional costs (e.g. broker fees)
<p>
that make existing transactions slower and more
expensive
<p>
•  Facilitates regulatory reporting requirements
<p>
(i.e. EMIR, MiFID II)
<p>
•  Increases efficiency by standardising data formats
<p>
across multiple organisations enabling inter-operability
and ensures process integrity
<p>
•  Reduces risk of fraud, error and invalid transactions
•  Reduces credit risk and transacting capital
<p>
requirements
